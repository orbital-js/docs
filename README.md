# Nest Documentation

Thanks for your intrest in contributing to the Nest docs.

For quick docs changes, you can just modify the respective Markdown file and Pull Request.

If you are making style changes, or want to build the docs, be sure to install Mkdocs.
```sh
$ pip install mkdocs
$ pip install mkdocs-material
$ pip install pygments
```

Installing these dependencies means you can successfully build and serve the docs. To see a live-reloading server, run `mkdocs serve`.
