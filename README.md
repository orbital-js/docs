# Orbital Documentation

Thanks for your intrest in contributing to the Orbital docs.

For quick docs changes, you can just modify the respective Markdown file and Pull Request.

If you are making style changes, or want to build the docs, be sure to install Mkdocs.

```sh
pip install mkdocs
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install pygments
```

Installing these dependencies means you can successfully build and serve the docs. To see a live-reloading server, run `mkdocs serve`.
